TODO:

Migrate MakeGoalItem function to goal_manager.js so that a checklist update
can be done without refreshing the page.

Work more on goal_manager.js for converting to react

Add a chevron to list items to better indicate the drop down

Make colouring between headings and panel better. Probably best 
to make it so that only the header changes on hover and the panel is 
a lighter colour than the heading.
